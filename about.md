Hi there,

I am an iOS developer at my day job, but also love open source stuff, learning about new things, listening to music.

I've been trying to understand [apple/swift][apple-swift] and want to contribute to Swift as well.

This website will be a way to announce any new app launches i make on the app store

You can reach out to me on any of the links below
